All necessary steps and packages are detailed in the colab notebook. We cloned the author's [repo](https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Unsupervised-Classification) and installed necessary packages to run the experiments in the submitted colab notebook. Experiments are in form of shell commands, therefore, rerunning the notebook is sufficient to reproduce the results. We followed the author's provided [tutorial guide](https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Unsupervised-Classification/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) for the use of commands.
